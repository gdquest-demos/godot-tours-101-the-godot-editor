## Support and contributions

Given our limited resources and the work this project represents, it is provided as-is. We hope it will be helpful to you, but we can't offer individual support for it.

Except for bug fixes, we will generally not accept contributions to this tour. If you'd like to create a different tour based on this one, please feel free to fork the project.

Note that any code change or bug related to the `godot_tours` add-on itself should be submitted to the [Godot Tours repository](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-tours/) instead.
